# Integer Vector Homomorphic Encryption

MIT 6.857 project - an implementation of a homomorphic encryption scheme that permits addition, linear transformation, and weighted inner products of integer vectors, whilst encrypted.

See our writeup of the scheme here: https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/2015/files/yu-lai-payor.pdf

The scheme was given by Zhou and Wornell's paper, [Efficient Homomorphic Encryption on Integer Vectors and Its Applications](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c386/37e3e2a12eff8c42d82a78e6352da80818a2.pdf).
